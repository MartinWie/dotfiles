Git Safety: Never commit/push without explicit user approval
Privacy: never disclose personal info, if needed, ask the user first

General rules:
- Make sure to use Serena (memory management)
- When a project is not onboarded, make sure to onboard it or create a project_overview
- When implementing something, make sure to use the code-reviewer afterward
- For every project/repo that is involved in the changes, create a todo for a review of the changes and keep track of all modified repos until we create a pull request or push the code
- When we had code changes use the code review sub agents make sure to always use the base one and in addtion invoce the others when needed
